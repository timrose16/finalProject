		<h2> <u>About the Company</u> </h2>	
	
		<h4> Jay P. Nichols: CEO and Chairman of Better Betters Inc. </h4>
		<center> <p> <img src="jay.jpg" alt="jay"> </p>
		<p>As an avid sports fan, Jay Nicholls had an idea that there must be some way to predict NFL games using math and statistics.  
		Using analysis of many years of NFL data, Better Betters was born.  Prior to starting Better Betters, Jay Nicholls was a Finance 
		major with a minor in Economics at Framingham State University.  While playing hockey for FSU as an assistant captain, Mr. Nicholls 
		was also involved in the community.  He was the President of the Business Leadership Club and also an intern at the MetroWest Economic 
		Research Center (MERC) studying and reporting on the Cost of Living.   </p> </center>
		
		<h4> Melvin T. Rose: CTO and Lead Software Engineer of Better Betters Inc. </h4>
		<center> <p> <img src="tim.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Tim" align= "absmiddle"> </p>
		<p>As a close friend to Jay Nicholls at Framingham State University, a small idea of a Better Betters company began in a dorm room.
		Prior to helping start Better Betters, Melvin Rose was a Computer Science major at Framingham State University
		with a concentration in Computer programming.  Their friendship was forged as Melvin and Jay met as teammates on
		Framingham State's ice hockey team.  Rose was also a certified Apple technician and successful Software Engineering 
		Intern at ElanTech Inc. in Greenbelt, MD. Rose is well versed in many different computer languages including Java, JavaScript, 
		C# and many more.

		<h3> <u> Our Mission </u> </h3>

	<p>	
 At Better Betters we strive to provide winning picks primarily for NFL games and also NCAA Football using data analytics and in-depth research. 
 Using historical data combined with intangible current knowledge of players, coaches, and long term trends among teams, we strive to analyze 
 every game to provide our customers with the most potentially profitable picks of the week.  A sophisticated algorithm is tested every Saturday 
 for College Football and Sunday for the NFL using vast amounts of data such as; points for/against, passing and rushing yards for/against and 
 much more. Using this algorithm to predict College Football and the National football league, Better Betters Inc. has established a high 
 percentage of wins that would help our customers not only invest smart, but continue to win smart.
